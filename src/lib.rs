//! Exact rational, symbolic real, and computable real arithmetic.
//!
//! `hyperreal` represents values as a mix of exact rationals, recognized
//! symbolic forms such as `pi`, `e`, logarithms, and trigonometric special
//! forms, and lazily evaluated computable expressions. The public structural
//! query APIs expose cheap conservative facts for callers that need to avoid
//! forcing high-precision evaluation. The lazy approximation layer follows the
//! exact-real arithmetic model described by Boehm et al.,
//! <https://doi.org/10.1145/319838.319860>.
//!
//! Exactness here is a certified-data contract, not a promise that every value
//! is eagerly reduced to one canonical scalar form. Following Yap's exact
//! geometric computation model, `Real` preserves rational, symbolic,
//! structural, and refinement facts so higher layers can make exact decisions
//! or return explicit uncertainty without hiding primitive-float fallbacks.
//! See Yap, "Towards Exact Geometric Computation," *Computational Geometry*,
//! 1997, pp. 3-23.
